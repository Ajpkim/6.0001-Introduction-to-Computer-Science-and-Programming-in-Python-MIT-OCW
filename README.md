# 6.0001-MIT-OCW-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-in-Python
Materials and completed problem sets from MIT's OCW course 6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" as taught during the Spring 2016 semester.

This course teaches the basics of computational thinking and python. The problem sets may be helpful for other's working through the class. Because this was an introduction the solutions are not optimal, but they work and only use the tools presented in the class at the time of problem set.
