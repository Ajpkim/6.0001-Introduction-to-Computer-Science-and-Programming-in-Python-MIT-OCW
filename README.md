Materials and completed problem sets from MIT's OCW course 6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python"

This course taught me the basics of computational thinking and python. The problem sets may be helpful for other's working through the class. Becuase this was an introduction, the solutions are not optimal, but they work and only use the tools presented in the class at the time of problem set.
